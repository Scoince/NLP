# NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language.

In Simple Terms:
NLP lets machines read text (like emails), hear speech (like Siri/Alexa), and respond in a way that makes sense to humans.

Examples of NLP in Action:
Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, customer service bots)
Voice Assistants (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant)
Spell Checkers (e.g., Grammarly, autocorrect)
Translation Tools (e.g., Google Translate)
Spam Filters (e.g., Gmail detecting junk emails)

How It Works:
Text Processing – Breaks down sentences into words/parts.
Understanding Meaning – Analyzes grammar, context, and intent.
Generating Responses – Creates replies, translations, or actions.
